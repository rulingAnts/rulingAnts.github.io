# Field Linguistics Extension Tools (FLET)

The **Field Linguistics Extension Tools (FLET)** project is a community-driven hub for developing high-utility, cross-platform tools designed to support and streamline the work of linguistic fieldworkers.

The goal of this repository is to bridge functional gaps in a unified workflow between popular linguistic software applications like [**FLEx**](https://software.sil.org/fieldworks/), [**ELAN**](https://archive.mpi.nl/tla/elan), [**SayMore**](https://software.sil.org/saymore/), [**Dekereke**](https://casali.canil.ca/Dekereke/), and [**Phonology Assistant**](https://software.sil.org/phonologyassistant/), by providing lightweight, dedicated utilities for data collection, conversion, and crowdsourcing.

## 🚀 Ready Tools

| Tool Name | Repository | Description | Tech Stack |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Flextext Editor](https://rulingants.github.io/flextext-editor/)** | `rulingAnts/flextext-editor` | An offline‑first, installable web app that duplicates FLEx's interlinear Baseline and Gloss tabs so native speakers can transcribe, gloss, and free‑translate `.flextext` files on any phone or computer, then share, save, or upload finished texts straight to a researcher's Google Drive. **Audio task links, in‑app recording with speaker‑permission consent receipts, EN/ID interface, fully offline (PWA).** | HTML/JavaScript (vanilla PWA), Service Worker, Google Apps Script (Drive relay) |
| **[Video Annotation Tool](https://github.com/rulingAnts/videoannotationtool/)** | `rulingAnts/videoannotationtool` | A desktop tool for easily recording video-prompted data (e.g., Max Planck kits). **Exports immediately ready for ELAN/SayMore (single WAV + click-separated entries).** | Python 3.11, Tkinter, Pydub |
| **[FLEx DiscourseChart Analysis Tool (FDAT)](https://github.com/rulingAnts/fdat)** | `rulingAnts/fdat` | An app that displays and exports FLEx Discourse Charts and in readable and useful ways (custom formating/show/hide for textchart markers, customizable salience scheme with color coding, free translations, "freeze panes" for chart headers, PDF/print view that shows headers on each page, ability to resize columns, and many more features planned). **A web app version runs entirely in your browser (with the option to install on Tablet and Desktop), but Windows, Mac, and Linux versions are also available for offline use.** | HTML/JavaScript, XSLT |
| **[Bulk Audio Normalizer](https://rulingants.github.io/bulk_audio_normalizer/)** | `rrulingants/bulk_audio_normalizer` | Field linguists and linguistics students with lots of recorded audio clips that may need some processing to be usable. If your recordings are too quiet, or there’s too much silence at the beginning/end, this app helps you clean them up quickly — no need to process files one-by-one. Two ways to batch process: for acoustic analysis/language documentation (increase the volume to the dieal level, trim silence with padding, but don't change anything else), and for human listening/participatory analysis (loudness normalization).
 | Node.js/Electron |
| **[FLEx XML Viewer/Exporter](https://github.com/rulingAnts/flexml_display)** | `rulingAnts/flexml_display` | An app that displays and exports Simple FLEx XML exports (Mainly Various Lists) in readable and useful ways (especially useful for extending the features of discourse charting and sharing charts in readable, user-friendly form with otehrs). **A web app version runs entirely in your browser, but Windows, Mac, and Linux versions are also available for offline use.** | HTML/JavaScript, XSLT |
| **[FLEx Interlinear Copy Assistant](https://github.com/rulingAnts/flex-interlinear-copy)** | `rulingAnts/flex-interlinear-copy` | Streamlines conversion of Tab-Separated Value (TSV) interlinear text from FLEx/spreadsheets into publication-ready **LaTeX**, **XLingPaper XML**, and **HTML**. | Python 3.11, Tkinter, Pyperclip, XML, CSV |
| **[Native-Speaker Excel Transcription/Back-Translation Tool](https://github.com/rulingAnts/FlexText-Excel-Import)** | `rulingAnts/FlexText-Excel-Import` | Facilitates text collection by allowing native speakers to transcribe and back-translate using an Excel template. **Converts Excel data to FLEx-ready FlexText.** | Python 3.8+, openpyxl, lxml |
| **[Oral Text Collection Web App](https://github.com/rulingAnts/online_recorder)** | `rulingAnts/online_recorder` | Facilitates text collection by allowing native speakers to use their web browsers to record native texts, this working prototype includes audio prompts in a minority language for informed consent and metadata. | HTML5/JavaScript, PHP, Google Apps Script |
| **[OSE Interlinear Viewer](https://github.com/rulingAnts/ose-interlinear-viewer)** | `rulingAnts/ose-interlinear-viewer` | Extracts interlinear texts from a OneStory Editor project file and then displays or exports them in HTML or XLingPaper format. | HTML5/JavaScript, XSLT, Electron |

## 🚀 Partially Usable (but very unfinished) Tools

| Tool Name | Repository | Description | Tech Stack |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Bulk Media File Manager](https://github.com/rulingAnts/bulk_mediafile_manager)** | `rulingAnts/videoannotationtool` | A desktop tool for bulk operations on media files -- bulk copy with filename prefixes/suffixes, format conversion (in progress), and more. | Python 3.11, Tkinter, Pydub |

## 🚀 Finished (But Not Yet Fully Uploaded) Tools

_These need GitHub repositories created with README, LICENSING, etc. The code is usable and so is the portable EXE, just not uploaded yet. All are copyright (c) 2025 Seth Johnston with AGPL3.0 License. Portable EXE links are provided below for these, they are distributed as is with no warranty or guarantee of any kind. Source code for each to be uploaded to repositories soon._

#### Dekereke Tools
1. **[Bulk Rename Files](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mCK573e2e3hFYWs2w-zrPkD8-LZZFE9M/view?usp=sharing)** - Uses a CSV file with old and new file names to rename a bunch of files at once (useful for managing audio files).
2. **[REGEX Search Tool](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PI5EqPNie34jCigDej6LU-KqDylgQd_y/view?usp=sharing)** - Actually kind of redundant and unimportant. Searches a Dekereke database using REGEX, but I think maybe now Dekereke actually has this built in?
3. **[Excel Import and Export](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PI5EqPNie34jCigDej6LU-KqDylgQd_y/view?usp=sharing)** - This is actually quite useful if you want to make major layout changes or other bulk changes to your database (or to set up a database with a lot of fields and precise column order). You *can* use copy and paste functions built in to Dekereke but these can be resource intensive and often can crash or freeze. This tool converts the Dekereke Database file to an Excel file and back again. I think the Excel export function also includes filtering and sorting which can be useful in some cases as well.
4. **[Export Anki Flashcards](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RoZrhaftJ3iXB4ApsBj4Aox2o10Jc3yT/view?usp=sharing)** - Exports a Dekereke database as Anki flashcards. If you have a "Picture" column that matches picture files in a picture folder, it can use these as well. To do in the future: make this work also with FLEx databases. Now *that* would be useful.
5. **[Sort Missing and Orphaned Files (simple)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RoZrhaftJ3iXB4ApsBj4Aox2o10Jc3yT/view?usp=sharing)** - *very* basic tool that compares your database and your sound files and tries to identify sound files that are orphaned or missing. This can be helpful if your sound files and database XML end up out of sync.
#### Sound File Management
1. **[Convert all WAV Files in a Folder to 16-bit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sKTTMdpeWXjm-t_GC-n1bKfONEYMom_T/view?usp=sharing)** - Self explanatory. Both FLEx and Dekereke work better with 16-bit wav. Turns out that's plenty high-quality enough for acoustic analysis and makes a HUGE difference in file size. FLEx "voice" writing system recordings only work with 16-bit wav.
2. **[Generate Blank WAV files (Based on a CSV Filenames list)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sKTTMdpeWXjm-t_GC-n1bKfONEYMom_T/view?usp=sharing)** - Believe it or not there is a use case for this. One such use case is an alternate workflow for video stimulus kits. Instead of using the video stimulus kit, you can instead generate blank wav files, and then open up a VLC playlist of video files and an list of Ocenaudio wav files side by side and work that way if you prefer.
